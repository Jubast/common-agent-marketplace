# stop-watch-arm.sh - the token-saving trick. Registered as a Stop hook with
# asyncRewake: true, so Claude Code runs this in the background at zero
# model cost every time the primary session's turn ends, and only "rewakes"
# the session (via exit 2 + stderr) if it finds something worth interrupting
# you for. chief-watch.sh does the actual polling; this script only
# interprets its exit.
#
# Deliberately NOT handled here (kept out for v1 simplicity): concurrent-arm
# locking, generation claims, beacon staleness backstops. Firstmate's
# equivalent (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh) solves those; this is the
# simpler version of the same idea, sized for one person's fleet.
