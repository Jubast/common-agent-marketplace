# stop-watch-arm.sh - the token-saving trick. Registered as a Stop hook with
# asyncRewake: true, so Claude Code runs this in the background at zero
# model cost every time the primary session's turn ends, and only "rewakes"
# the session (via exit 2 + stderr) if it finds something worth interrupting
# you for. chief-watch.sh does the actual polling; this script only
# interprets its exit.
#
# Concurrent arms are resolved by chief-watch.sh itself (the newest watcher
# takes over; an older one exits silently, which this script must not rewake
# on). Beacon staleness backstops are deliberately not handled.
