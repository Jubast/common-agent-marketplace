# paths.sh - shared path resolution, sourced by every chief-*.sh entrypoint
# and the hooks. Pure definitions; chief_ensure_dirs is the only thing that
# touches disk, and entrypoints that write under state/, config/ or worktrees/
# call it explicitly.
#
# Two roots, never confused:
#   CHIEF_ROOT  the plugin's own installed files (bin/, templates/, skills/) -
#               read-only, resolved from this script's own location so it
#               works whether Claude Code installed the plugin or a developer
#               is running it straight out of a checkout.
#   CHIEF_HOME  the operator's one shared runtime home. Defaults to
#               <outermost git root>/.chief of wherever the Chief session
#               runs (never inside a project - see home.sh), override with
#               the CHIEF_HOME env var. This is gitignored working state,
#               never plugin code. Its layout:
#
#   tasks/<id>/   one folder per task: meta status inbox/ lifecycle turn-ended
#                 brief.md report.md evidence/
#   archive/<id>/ a torn-down task's folder
#   state/        global machine state only: locks, agent cursors, trust-owned,
#                 watcher heartbeat
#   backlog.md    the backlog
#   config/       operator configuration
#   worktrees/    one disposable checkout per task
#
# Every bin/chief-*.sh entrypoint sources this before anything else, relative
# to its own directory - "lib/paths.sh" from bin/, "../lib/paths.sh" from
# bin/task/ or bin/pr/.

# This file always lives at <plugin-root>/bin/lib/paths.sh, so its own
# location - not the caller's - is what tells us where the plugin root is.
