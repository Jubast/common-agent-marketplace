# run against the `mock` backend (no `claude` CLI, zero tokens).
# test-backend-orca-mock.sh is also zero-cost - it unit-tests
# backends/orca.sh against a fake `orca` CLI. test-backend-herdr.sh and
# test-backend-orca.sh are the exceptions: each opts into a real
# herdr/orca install and a real claude turn, skipped by default - see this
# directory's README.md. Skill-BEHAVIOR tests (does Claude actually follow
# using-chief/dispatch/reviewer/setup correctly) live in tests/claude-code/
# instead.
